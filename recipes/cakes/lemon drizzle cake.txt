ingredients
flour for dusting the pan
1 stick butter, softened, plus more for greasing the pan
3/4 cup superfine sugar
2 large, free-range eggs, beaten
finely grated zest and juice of 3 lemons
1 1/2 cups all-purpose or light spelt flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 cup milk
1/2 cup confectioner's sugar, sifted
preparation

Preheat the oven to 350°F. Butter and flour a 9-inch non-stick loaf pan.

In a medium mixing bowl, cream the butter and sugar together with a wooden spoon (or use an electric mixer). Gradually beat in the eggs and mix until light and fluffy. Stir in the lemon zest, flour, and baking powder, and mix well. Add 2 tablespoons of the lemon juice and mix well again. Then beat in the milk.

Pour the cake batter evenly into the prepared loaf pan and bake for 45 minutes.

In the meantime, mix the remaining lemon juice and the confectioner's sugar together in a small bowl to make a glaze.

When it's ready, take the cake out of the oven and cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Then turn it out onto a plate. Pierce the top of the cake all over with a thin skewer. Spoon the lemon glaze carefully and evenly over the cake until all of it is absorbed. Ready to eat.
