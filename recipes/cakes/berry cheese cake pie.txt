Ingredients
8 sheets phyllo dough (14 inches x 9 inches)
6 tablespoons butter, melted
2 packages (8 ounces each) cream cheese, softened
1/2 cup sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 eggs, lightly beaten
2 cups fresh or frozen blueberries
1/2 cup strawberry jelly
1 cup whipped topping
Sliced fresh strawberries and additional blueberries, optional

METHOD:
Place one phyllo sheet in a greased 9-in. pie plate; brush with butter. Repeat seven times; trim edges. (Keep remaining phyllo covered with plastic wrap and a damp towel to prevent it from drying out.)
Bake at 425° for 6-8 minutes or until edges are lightly browned (center will puff up). Cool on a wire rack.
For filling, in a large bowl, beat the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla until smooth. Add eggs; beat on low speed just until combined. Fold in blueberries. Spoon into crust.
Bake at 350° for 10 minutes; cover edges with foil to prevent overbrowning. Bake 23-27 minutes longer or until center is almost set. Cool on a wire rack for 1 hour. Refrigerate until chilled.
In a small bowl, beat jelly until smooth; spread over filling. Spread with whipped topping. Garnish with strawberries and additional blueberries if desired. Yield: 6-8 servings.


Editor's Note: If using frozen blueberries, use without thawing to avoid discoloring the batter.
